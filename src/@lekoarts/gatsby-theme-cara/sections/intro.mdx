# Hi, I'm Shubhampreet Singh
And I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2017 when I decided to study Information Technology and try editing custom clients 's websites and that taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!. Now I'm looking for a web development role in your organisation.
